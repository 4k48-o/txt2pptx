Create a new project to organize tasks and apply consistent instructions across multiple tasks.

## Request Body

| Field         | Type   | Required | Description                                                           |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | string | Yes      | The name of the project                                               |
| `instruction` | string | No       | Default instruction that will be applied to all tasks in this project |

## Example Request

```bash  theme={null}
curl -X POST "https://api.manus.ai/v1/projects" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "API_KEY: your-api-key" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Research Project",
    "instruction": "You must start every response with a summary of key findings"
  }'
```

## Example Response

```json  theme={null}
{
  "id": "proj_abc123",
  "name": "Research Project",
  "instruction": "You must start every response with a summary of key findings",
  "created_at": 1699900000
}
```

## Using Projects with Tasks

Once you've created a project, you can assign tasks to it by including the `project_id` in your task creation request:

```bash  theme={null}
curl -X POST "https://api.manus.ai/v1/tasks" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "API_KEY: your-api-key" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Analyze this data",
    "agent_profile": "manus-1.6",
    "project_id": "proj_abc123"
  }'
```

The project's instruction will be automatically applied to all tasks created within that project.
